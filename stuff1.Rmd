Suppose n students are called down
Assuming nobody takes more than 10 tries (that would be embarrasing)
```{r}
n = 10000
data <- sample.int(10, n, replace = TRUE)
#MLE for p = n/sum(ki) = 1/sample mean, where ki is the observation for each trial
p_est <- n/sum(data)
p_est

```
Bias and SE of p_est

Bias = E(p_est) - p = E(n/sum(ki)) - p.
By Jensen's Inequality, p_est is biased.
Biasness can be estimated with 2nd degree Taylor expansion.
p_est is consistent. Both bias and SE decreases with n.


```{r}
simulation <- rgeom(100000, p_est)
mean(simulation)
```
